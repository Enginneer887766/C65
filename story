The Proud Rose

Once upon a time, there was a beautiful rose in a garden.
One rose flower on the plant was proud of its beauty. However, it was dissappointed that it was growing next to an ugly cactus.
Everyday the rose would insult the cactus about its look, but the cactus stayed quiet all the other plants in the garden tried to stop the rose from bullying the cactus,
but the rose was to swayed by its own beauty to listen to anyone. One summer a well in the garden dried up there was no water for the plants,
the rose slowly began to wilt. The rose saw a sparrow dip its beak into the cactus for some water, the rose then felt ashamed for having made fun of cactus all this time.
